## Network issues
In the event that a connection to the notabase cannot be established when loading the website or after performing any of the above actions, a loading screen will be displayed indicating the anticipated time to reconnect.

If a connection still cannot be made after the time limit, it will continue to try and reconnect. 
A message will be displayed saying that it's taking longer than anticipated. It's not your fault, there is likely a problem with the backend of our program.

There is nothing much that can be done on the user's end but to wait for a connection to establish.
